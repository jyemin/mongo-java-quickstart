# MongoDB Java Quickstart

Get started quickly using MongoDB and Java.  

Using the [gradle wrapper](http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) to manage dependencies all 
that's needed to get up and running and connecting to MongoDB via the Java Driver is:

```
./gradlew quickStart
```

`QuickStart.java` will connect to the local MongoDB and count the number of documents in a test collection.  
From there you can start and run test code or build your own application.
